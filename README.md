### Workflow
For each task / story you are working on, you should create a new branch. The branch name should be the name of the task. Once the task is complete, you should create a pull request and ping one of the Software Leads on discord. The leads will then review the code and merge the branch into the main branch.

**Example (Branch Names):** \
feature/landing-page \
bugfix/fixing-navbar
