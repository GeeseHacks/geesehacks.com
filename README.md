## Workflow
For each task, you should create a new branch. The branch name should be the name of the task. Once the task is complete, you should create a pull request and ping one of the Software Leads on discord. The leads will then review the code and merge the branch into the main branch.

Example:
feature/landing-page
bugfix/fixing-navbar
